This document is intended as a quick reference and showcase on how to use Markdown language to create Antracticle articles and comments. For more complete info, see [John Gruber's original spec](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and the [Github-flavored Markdown info page](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).

## Headers

```no-highlight
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6
```

## Emphasis

```no-highlight
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## Lists

```no-highlight
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
  * Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
4. And another item.

   Some text that should be aligned with the above item.

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
```

## Links

There are two ways to create links. Inline links can contain some explanatory text to substitute the URL. The other way is to simply use bare URL address:

```no-highlight
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)
https://www.mozilla.org
```

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't. However, Antarcticle render supports syntax highlighting for the following languages: C and friends, Java, Python, Bash, SQL, HTML, XML, CSS, Javascript, Makefiles, and Rust. It works passably on Ruby, PHP, VB, and Awk and a decent subset of Perl and Ruby, but, because of commenting conventions, but doesn't work on Smalltalk. Some examples on how to use it:

```no-highlight
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
```

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks *\`\`\`*, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.


    ```javascript
    var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
    alert(s);
    ```

    ```python
    s = "Python syntax highlighting"
    print s
    ```

    ```
    No language indicated, so parser will try to guess the language.
    Let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
    ```
result in

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```

## Tables

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM.

```no-highlight
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

## Blockquotes

```no-highlight
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

## Horizontal Rule

```no-highlight
Three or more...

---

Hyphens

***

Asterisks

___

Underscores
```

___

## Line Breaks

Here are some things to try out:

```no-highlight
Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
```
